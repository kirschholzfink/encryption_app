# encryption_app

This app encrypts as well as decrypts data.

Upon executing the file, the program will prompt the user to enter parameters used to encrypt or decrypt data.

In order to decrypt a file that has previously been encrypted with a set of parameters, the same parameters should be used.

As encryption quality depends significantly on the complexity of your parameters, to give it a quick try,
here's my recommendation:

a : 421

b : 54,773

m : 259,200

key : e.g. 3

I've also included "Gedicht.txt" as a sample file for you to use.
