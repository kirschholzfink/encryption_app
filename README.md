# encryption_app

This app encrypts as well as decrypts data.

Upon executing the file, the program will prompt the user to enter parameters used in the de-/encryption process.

As encryption quality significantly depends on the complexity of your parameters, to give it a quick try, 
you may want to use these sample ones:

a : 421

b : 54,773

m : 259,200

key : e.g. 3

As a sample file, I've included "Gedicht.txt".

(In order to decrypt a file that has previously been encrypted with a set of parameters, naturally, the same parameters should be used.)
